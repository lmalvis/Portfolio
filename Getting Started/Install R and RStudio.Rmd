Both R and RStudio are free and easy to download. Many free, online resources explain these steps in more detail, but here are the basics.  
  
# Install R First

The first step is to install R. You can download and install R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/) (CRAN).  

```{r download-r-img, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("downloadRscreenshot.png")
```

**Windows:**

- Click [Download R for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/) option.
- Select [base](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), since this is our first installation of R on our computer.  
- Click on the link for downloading the latest version of R (an .exe file).  
- When the download completes, double-click on the .exe file and follow the standard instructions. If asked to select Customize Startup or Accept Default Startup Options, **choose the default options**.   
  
  
**Mac:**

- Click [Download R for MacOS X](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).  
- Look for the most up-to-date version of R (new versions are released frequently and appear toward the top of the page) and click the .pkg file to download.    
- When the download completes, double-click the .pkg file and follow the standard instructions.  
- Drag and drop the R application into the Applications folder.

# Install RStudio
  
Now that R is installed, you can install [Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)  
  

```{r download-rstudio-img, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("downloadRstudioscreenshot.png")
```
  
- Click "DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP FOR WINDOWS" or scroll down to "All Installers and Tarballs" to find your appropriate installation file for your system.   
- Run the installation file.  
  

# Install packages  

Install a few commonly used packages using `install.packages("packagename")  

```{r eval=FALSE}
packageList<-c("tidyverse", "janitor", "dplyr", "ggplot2")

# checks if each package is installed; if not, install it
for (pkg in packages) {
  if (!require(pkg, character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
    library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
  }
}

```

You can also install rmarkdown to create want to create dynamic documents that combine code, text, and rendered output in R.  

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown", dependencies = TRUE)
```

If you want to generate PDF output from rmarkdown, you will also need to install LaTeX.  

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex() 
```
