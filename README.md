# Portfolio   
Welcome to my R Portfolio! 

## About Me  
I'm Lauren Alvis, a developmental psychologist and applied quantitative statistician passionate about leveraging data to advance equity and well-being. 

## About This Portfolio  
This portfolio features a collection of RMarkdown (.Rmd) projects designed to be both educational and practical. Each project includes annotated code and clear explanations to support learning and replication. Together, they reflect my ability to:  
- Manage and analyze data using efficient, reproducible workflows in R
- Conduct statistical analyses, including linear regression, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and measurement invariance testing
- Create intuitive and meaningful data visualizations
- Communicate findings clearly using RMarkdown for technical and non-technical audiences  

## Featured Projects  
  
**1. Getting Started in R**  
  - There are many wonderful resources available for getting started in r (e.g., [R-Ladies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/01-basicbasics-1/)).  
  - In [this tutorial](https://lmalvis.github.io/Portfolio/Getting%20Started/Install-R-and-RStudio.html), I've included the basics for installing R & Rstudio.  

**2. Linear Regression in R**  
  - This project provides a step-by-step guide for beginners in performing linear regression analysis in R using a Frequentist (i.e., traditional) and Bayesian approach. It covers key concepts like **descriptive statistics**, **model fitting**, and **results interpretation**, making it a practical resource for those new to regression.

**3. Applied Psychometrics in R**  
  - This project explores **Confirmatory Factor Analysis** (CFA) and **Measurement Invariance** testing using lavaan. It includes **model building**, creating **functions & loops** to streamline repetitive analyses, and conducting group comparisons, making it a valuable resource for those working with **multi-group latent variable models**.
