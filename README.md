# Portfolio   
Welcome to my R Portfolio! This collection highlights my expertise in R, statistical analysis, data management, and data visualization through a series of RMarkdown (.Rmd) projects. Each project showcases different analytical techniques, with detailed code and explanations to help you follow along or apply similar approaches to your own work.

## About This Portfolio  
The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to:  
- Analyze and manage data using efficient workflows in R
- Perform statistical analyses, including regression, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and measurement invariance testing
- Visualize data
- Document and present analysis clearly using RMarkdown
  
## Featured Projects  
**1. Regression in R Tutorial**
  - This project provides a step-by-step guide for beginners in performing linear regression analysis in R using a Frequentist (i.e., traditional) and Bayesian approach. It covers key concepts like **descriptive statistics**, **model fitting**, and **result interpretation**, making it a practical resource for those new to regression.

**2. CFA & Measurement Invariance Testing in R**
  - This project explores Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Measurement Invariance testing using lavaan. It includes **model setup**, creating **functions & loops** to streamline repetitive analyses, and conducting group comparisons, making it a valuable resource for those working with **multi-group latent variable models**.
