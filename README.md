# R Portfolio   
Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This collection highlights my expertise in R, statistical analysis, data management, and data visualization through a series of RMarkdown (.Rmd) projects. Each project showcases different analytical techniques, with detailed code and explanations to help you follow along or apply similar approaches to your own work.

## About This Portfolio  
The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to:  
- Analyze and manage data using efficient workflows in R.
- Perform advanced statistical analyses, including regression, CFA, and measurement invariance testing.
- Visualize data using R's rich visualization libraries.
- Document and present analysis clearly using RMarkdown.
  
## Featured Projects  
**1. Regression in R Tutorial**
  - This project provides a step-by-step guide for beginners in performing linear regression analysis in R using a traditional/frequentist vs Bayesian approach. It covers key concepts like **descriptive statistics, model fitting**, and **result interpretation**, making it a practical resource for those new to regression.

**2. Measurement Invariance & CFA in R**
  - This project explores Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Measurement Invariance testing in R. It delves into model setup, creating functions & loops to streamline repetitive analyses, and conducting group comparisons, making it a valuable resource for those working with multi-group latent variable models.
